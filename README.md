# 🎨 ArtFlow – Artistic Social Platform

 ## Project Idea:
ArtFlow is an innovative artistic social platform designed to empower artists to showcase their artworks and connect with a broad audience of art enthusiasts. The application provides an interactive environment where users can discover artworks, participate in weekly challenges, and engage with artists through comments, likes, and direct messaging.

---

## Problem It Solves:
Many artists, especially independents, face difficulties reaching a wide audience and lack an effective platform to display their work and communicate with interested viewers. Similarly, art lovers lack a centralized, interactive, and organized space that connects them with artists and art events.
