        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I started this platform as a passionate developer and art enthusiast who saw how many talented artists lacked a place to shine. Combining my tech skills and love for creativity, I built this project to help artists gain visibility, connect with admirers, and make a living doing what they love.

      <section className="aboutme-section">
        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To build a supportive and inspiring community for emerging and professional artists alike â€” a space where talent meets opportunity and creativity knows no limits. I envision a platform where every artwork finds its audience and every artist feels seen.
